H8a. Across young controls: does PPS plasticity go with Hit-or-Miss performance?

WHAT WE ARE TESTING
-------------------
Delta_PPS measures how much a person moves their PPS boundary when the stimulus
speeds up. It is a measure of how PLASTIC their body-space representation is.

If that plasticity is a real, general ability, then people who have more of it
should also do better on the Hit-or-Miss task. Three predictions:

    H8a.1  more PPS plasticity  ->  more collision-boundary plasticity
           correlate Delta_PPS with Delta_coll.  Predicted POSITIVE.

    H8a.2  more PPS plasticity  ->  better accuracy near the boundary
           correlate Delta_PPS with near-boundary accuracy.  Predicted POSITIVE.
           (Near-boundary accuracy is the PRIMARY measure. Overall accuracy is
           reported too, but only as a descriptive extra: most trials are easy,
           so overall accuracy is dominated by trials that tell us nothing.)

    H8a.3  more PPS plasticity  ->  LESS carryover
           correlate Delta_PPS with carryover.  Predicted NEGATIVE.
           Carryover means the previous trial's speed is still influencing your
           decision boundary. That is a failure to update, so someone who updates
           well should show less of it. Note this is the only one where we expect
           a NEGATIVE correlation, so we use alternative='less'.

WHY AN EXACT PERMUTATION TEST
-----------------------------
With 5 participants, a normal p-value from a correlation table is meaningless.
Instead we enumerate ALL 5! = 120 possible ways of pairing up the two variables
and count how many give a correlation at least as extreme as the real one.
That is exact, not approximate.

Be honest about what this can detect: at n = 5, a one-sided exact p < 0.05
requires rho >= 0.9. So a null result here does not mean there is no relationship.
It means we could not have detected anything short of a near-perfect one.
